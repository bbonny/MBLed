List of the folders :
*applications : Applications files for the MB Led. There you can put your application.
*bloc : Files for the MB Led system.
*common : Files to write in flash.
*dataAnim : Files resulting from the gif2glip's program. 
*gif2glip : Files to convert a gif in a GLiP/MBLed animation (thanks to the GLiP project)
*License : The FreeRTOS license
*Source :  FreeRTOS files.
*STM32: STM32 files.
 

The applications can work on GLiP or MBLed.
To define which modules you want to use, change the bloc/Makefile : there is a line -DMBLED by default.
(You can put -DGLIP for GLiP or -DGLIP_DEBUG, if it's for a GLiP debug)


Block can send to :
*An interface (equivalent of an UART)
*Everybody (it's a broadcast)
*Everybody except one neighbor (it's a spread)
