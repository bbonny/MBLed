Example description
===================
In modern PCs, USB is the standard communication port for almost all peripherals. 
However many industrial software applications still use the classic COM Port (UART).
The Virtual COM Port Demo provides a simple solution to bypass this problem; it
uses the USB-FS-Device as a COM port by affecting the legacy PC application designed for
COM Port communication.
This Virtual COM Port Demo provides the firmware examples for the STM32F10xxx
family.

Note that with this demo only the following configuration are supported:
-> 7bit data with parity (Even or Odd).
-> 8bit data with and without parity.


More details about this Demo implementation is given in the User manual 
"UM0424 STM32F10xxx USB development kit", available for download from the ST
microcontrollers website: www.st.com/stm32

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL, STM3210C-EVAL and 
STM3210E-EVAL evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

    
How to use it
=============
 + RVMDK
    - Open the VirtualCOMPort.Uv2 project
    - In the build toolbar select the project config:
        - STM3210B-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 Medium-density devices
        - STM3210C-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 Connectivity-Line devices
        - STM3210E-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 High-density devices
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
    - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session
    - Run program: Debug->Run (F5)    

 + EWARM5
    - Open the VirtualCOMPort.eww workspace.
    - In the workspace toolbar select the project config:
        - STM3210B-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 Medium-density devices
        - STM3210C-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 Connectivity-Line devices
        - STM3210E-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 High-density devices
    - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
    - Load project image: Project->Debug
    - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)

 + RIDE
    - Open the VirtualCOMPort.rprj project.
    - In the configuration toolbar(Project->properties) select the project config:
        - STM3210B-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 Medium-density devices
        - STM3210C-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 Connectivity-Line devices
        - STM3210E-EVAL: to configure the project for STM32 High-density devices
    - Rebuild all files: Project->build project
    - Load project image: Debug->start(ctrl+D)
    - Run program: Debug->Run(ctrl+F9)  

NOTE:
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 32 and 128 Kbytes.
 - High-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - Connectivity-Line devices are STM32F105xx and STM32F107xx microcontrollers.
